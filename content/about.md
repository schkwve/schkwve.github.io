Hello! I am Jozef Nagy, an 18 year old software developer from Czechia.
I specialize in operating system development, embedded systems and everything low-level.

Currently, I'm writing a multi-platform operating system, [AurixOS](https://github.com/aurixos/os)! Apart from this, I'm working on a lot of side projects, which include: [Zircon](https://github.com/schkwve/zircon), an IRC client, [Yoghurt](https://github.com/schkwve/yoghurt), a small web server, and [Pretty SHell](https://github.com/schkwve/psh), a minimal UNIX shell implementation.

Outside of coding, I'm passionate about tinkering with electronics, and creating new cool stuff!
